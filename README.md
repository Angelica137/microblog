# Angelica's little blog

This is a microblog built as full-stack web app coded on Python, Flask, SQL.

The live version lives here - https://angelicas-flask-microblog.herokuapp.com/ âœ¨

## Motivation

I worked on this project to continue to learn full-stack software web development with Python.

I chose this particular project because it uses the skills I need to build my personal projects, including relational database design with one to one, one to many and many to many relationships.

## Features

- User authentication
- Profile avatars
- Follow other users
- Email support
- Pagination and page navigation
- Asynchronous functions and multi-threading
- Translations

## Technologies

- Flask
- Postgres
- werkzeug and hashlib for password security
- jwt.io for password reset tokens
- Babel

## Set up and run App

**Create a virtual environment**

`<python3 -m venv env>`

**Activate your virtual environment**

`<source env/bin/activate>`

**Install the required dependencies**

`<pip3 install -r requirements.txt>`

**To run the app**

`<flask run>`

## Credits

To build this project, I used both **"Learning Flask Framework"** by Matt Copperwaite and Charles Leifer, published by Packt on Nov 2015 and **"The Flask Mega-Tutorial"** from Miguel Grinberg https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/

Both are great resources, and it is not necessary to use both. Still, the goal of this project was to learn the technologies, I need for other projects, and I found using both resources incredibly helpful, particularly the chapters regarding databases.
